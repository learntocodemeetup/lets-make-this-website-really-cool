# lets-make-this-website-really-cool

We worked on this at the meetup on May 10, 2015 - Mother's Day. 

The aim was to create a simple blog site that illustrates the basic concepts of HTML and CSS. The CSS is fully 
commented out with explanations about what properties do and why they are being used. 

We went through a mixture of basic styling, fonts, colours, background colours and some different ways to look at 
layouts including floats and a little bit at flexbox.
